ping pong stats nov 21

Dojo Ping Pong is a statistics site where Coding Dojo students can enter in ping pong scores and view various individual statistics, including match history and opponent stats.

It also features a unique rating system that accounts for match scores and opponent ratings, ability to add/delete players and matches, post messages

Built with: PHP, CodeIgniter, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, AJAX, MySQL. (This was a lot of fun to build and I especially enjoyed writing up the calculations for all the stats.)
